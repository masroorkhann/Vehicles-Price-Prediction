# Vehicles-Price-Prediction
A machine learning regression model to predict prices of vehicles.


*Using ML libraries sklearn and statsmodels, a multiple linear regression model is created based on the dataset to predict prices of vehicles.
*The data needs to be pre-processed, converting the dummy variables to catagorical data or numerical data.
*OLS assumptions as verified.
*The model has an R-squared value of 0.76, this is considered as a decent value.
*The model has good predicting power as can be seen from the plot that compares both predicted and test values.



---Libraries Used---
